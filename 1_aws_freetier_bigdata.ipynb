    "## Using AWS Free Tier for Big Data Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Free Tier provides a great starting point for learning and experimenting with Big Data technologies. While it has limitations in compute and memory, many tools can still be explored in a single-node setup or using serverless services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ What You Can Do on AWS Free Tier\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Apache Spark (Single-node)**: Run in local mode on a `t2.micro` EC2 instance for small-scale PySpark development.\n",
    "- **Apache Hadoop (Pseudo-distributed)**: Practice HDFS, MapReduce on a single node.\n",
    "- **Apache Hive**: Integrate with Hadoop for SQL-based querying.\n",
    "- **Apache Airflow**: Run lightweight workflows for ETL orchestration.\n",
    "- **Amazon S3**: Store up to 5 GB of data for use with other services.\n",
    "- **Amazon Athena**: Run serverless SQL queries on S3 data.\n",
    "- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**: Use a micro instance for metadata storage and small-scale databases.\n",
    "- **AWS Glue**: Run limited ETL jobs using the monthly free tier quota.\n",
    "- **AWS Lambda**: Perform lightweight event-driven data processing with 1M free requests/month.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations to Keep in Mind\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory and CPU Constraints**: t2.micro/t3.micro (1 vCPU, ~1 GB RAM) can handle only lightweight workloads.\n",
    "- **No Multi-node Clusters**: Distributed computing with multiple EC2 nodes is not feasible under the Free Tier.\n",
    "- **Limited Storage**: 5 GB S3, minimal EBS and RDS storage‚Äîuse efficiently.\n",
    "- **Not Suitable for Kafka or Flink**: These tools need more power and are not practical in Free Tier setups.\n",
    "\n",

    "Use the Free Tier to gain hands-on experience and build proof-of-concept pipelines. For more advanced or production-scale work, consider upgrading to larger EC2 instances or local alternatives like WSL2 or Docker.\n"
