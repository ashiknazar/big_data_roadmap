    "### Evolution from Open-Source Hadoop to Commercial Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hadoop (Open Source Initiation)**\n",
    "   - Hadoop was developed as an open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of big data.\n",
    "   - Released under the **Apache Software Foundation (ASF)** license.\n",
    "   - Made freely available for anyone to use, modify, and experiment with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Role of Apache Software Foundation (ASF)**\n",
    "   - ASF acts as the governing body for Hadoop but does **not provide official support**.\n",
    "   - Hadoop is mostly tested and enhanced by the **research and development community**.\n",
    "   - ASF encourages local implementation for **learning or Proof of Concept (PoC)**.\n",
    "   - If users face infrastructure or scalability issues, they **cannot rely on ASF** for assistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Need for Commercial Support**\n",
    "   - Enterprises needed:\n",
    "     - **Production-level stability**\n",
    "     - **Technical support**\n",
    "     - **Security**, **User Interfaces**, and **Integration tools**\n",
    "   - This created a gap between open-source Hadoop and enterprise demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Emergence of Commercial Hadoop Distributions**\n",
    "   - Companies stepped in to fill this gap, creating **enterprise-ready versions of Hadoop**.\n",
    "   - These organizations:\n",
    "     - Understood the open-source base thoroughly.\n",
    "     - **Added missing enterprise features** (security, UI, monitoring, etc.).\n",
    "     - Provided **24/7 support**, training, and deployment services.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Examples of Commercial Hadoop Platforms**\n",
    "   - **Cloudera** (also includes former Hortonworks HDP)\n",
    "   - **AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce)**\n",
    "   - **Microsoft HDInsight**\n",
    "   - **IBM BigInsights**\n",
    "   - **MapR** (M3, M5, M7 editions)\n",
    "   - **Databricks** (DB Sandbox) â€“ Spark-centric, but built on Hadoop ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸ“Œ In short:  \n",
    "> **Open-source Hadoop** started the movement, **ASF provided the platform**, but **commercial vendors made it enterprise-ready.**\n"
